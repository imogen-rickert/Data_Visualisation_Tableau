## Project Description

I wanted to examine wealth inequality and democracy globally. I downloaded the 'GapMinder Income Inequality' dataset in csv form from Kaggle and worked with Tableau to create interesting visualisations. My Tableau story consists of 8 story points with a range of visualisations and annotations. 


## Questions & Hypotheses

My work was guided by the following questions:

1. Which countries in the world have the lowest and highest levels of income inequality?
2. How has income inequality changed from 2006 to 2016?
3. Which countries have the lowest and highest levels of democracy?
4. How has this changed from 2006 to 2016?

As I began to work with my data, I found some interesting trends that I wanted to explore further. 

Firstly, I noticed that while income inequality is very high in the Americas, it has been decreasing quite substantially from 2006 to 2016. I looked closer at the inequality levels in countries in the Americas and made further visualisations and notes on key findings. 

Secondly, I noticed that while Europe has overall a high score for democracy, it appeared to have been decreasing slightly from 2006 to 2016. I investigated further and found significant regional differences, which I showed with further visualisations and observations. 


## Dataset

I utilised the GapMinder Income Inequality' dataset, which I located on Kaggle. Its data comes from Gap Minder, a non-profit based in Sweden. Further details on the dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/psterk/income-inequality?select=combined_final_last_10_years.csv


## Workflow

I first chose my topic and dataset, and then began to examine the dataset. As my dataset was already clean, with clear headings and few missing values, it was not necessary to clean or manipulate the data before starting work.

I took an exploratory approach to working with the data. I experimented with different regional groupings of the data to look for interesting findings and searched for any changes over time. I then selected two areas that I wanted to explore further and created 'close ups' to do so. I took notes on interesting findings as a worked, then used them to create concise captions alongside the visualisations. Along the way, I found some explorations did not lead to particularly interesting findings so I decided to exclude them. For example, I found that democracy levels in the Americas had not changed drastically in the time period for which I had data (2006-2016), so I did not include additional visualisations on that. However, I would be interested in exploring this further in a future data with more recent data, considering the rise in populism and political activism in the region in recent years. 


## Organization

This repository contains this readme file and the GapMinder dataset that I used for my visualisations, in csv form. My Tableau story can be found in the link below.
